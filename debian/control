Description: Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the NTP daemon and utility programs.  An NTP
 daemon needs to be running on each host that is to have its clock
 accuracy controlled by NTP.  The same NTP daemon is also used to
 provide NTP service to other hosts.
 .
 For more information about the NTP protocol and NTP server
 configuration and operation, install the package "ntp-doc".

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

Description: Network Time Protocol documentation
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains HTML documentation for the ntp packages (ntp,
 ntpdate).  Since there are no substantive man pages for ntp's
 programs and configuration files, this package is desirable for any
 setup beyond the simple default configuration.
